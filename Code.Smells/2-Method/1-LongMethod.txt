SMELL : LONG METHOD
TYPE  : BLOATER

DEFINITION
Prefer shorter methods to longer methods.Small methods can
have better names,because they're doing less,and since they can
be well-named,are small,and don't do much,they're easier than
long methods to understand.


ANALYSIS

Small methods
Methods should fit on one screen (no scrolling)
Ideally fewer than 10 lines of code.
Easier to write test for.

Refactoring long methods
1. Extract Method. Sometimes a comment on top of some lines of code is a code name for an extracted method.
2. Compose Method. The compose method refactoring turns a long method into a high-level method that delegates to
   several other lower-level methods to do the detail work. TemplateMethod is an example of a composed method.
   If you have a very detailed long method with many steps, you can extract method on each step until only the
   high-level workflow remains in the original composed method.
3. Replace nested conditional with guard clause.
4. Replace conditional dispatcher with command using command design pattern.
5. Move accumulation to visitor using visitor design pattern.
6. Replace conditional logic with strategy using strategy design pattern.
