SMELL : PARALLEL INHERITANCE HERARCHIES
TYPE  : CHANGE PREVENTER

DEFINITION
Two concepts are both modeled with inheritance hierarchies, and any change in one
requires a matching change in the other.

SOLUTION
Keep one hierarchy and the methods from the other hierarchy that currently are handled by
specific subclasses to be collapsed up into methods in a single class perhaps with 
each method prefixed as appropriate to the service that it's going to work with.
Using this approach a new method may still need to be created with each new child of
shipping service but at least all the methods are confined to a single class.
This approach make sense when there are very few child classes and only one or two 
methods in the reference classes that need to be collapsed into one class.
If parallel hierarchies are not causing you pain, and you are not added stuff all the time
it is better to keep them from SOLID point of view, rather than adding them to a single class.
