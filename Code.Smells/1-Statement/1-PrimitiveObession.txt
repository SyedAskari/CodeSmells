SMELL : PRIMITIVE OBESSION
TYPE  : BLOATER

DEFINITION
Overuse of primitives, instead of better abstractions or
data structures, results in excess code required to enforce
constraints.

SOLUTION
Introduce named variables
Use named arguments
Replace primitive with constants for revealing name 
Replace primitive with enum/SmartEnum if you have more than few options
 
ANALYSIS
Part of problem also lies with the method signature that
relies on primitives AddHolidays or DateTime.
In later examples we will look at how to solve this issue.

EXTRAS
